2nd Version of webscraper (1st version died with laptop D:)

Make sure "main.py" and the .bat/.sh files are in the same folder.

HEADSUP- A couple of pip modules will be installed onto your machine

# How to run:
If you're on Windows, run the .bat file

Open this directory in your terminal (right click in the folder and click 'open in terminal'
Copy paste the command below into the terminal
"chmod +x runMAC.sh"
Press enter
You should now be able to run the file as an executable by double clicking on the .sh file
If it still only brings up the text editor, run this command in your terminal
"./runMAC.sh"

IF the program still does not run properly, do contact me

After executing the program, a terminal should appear counting through records.
It should also output a CSV file named "Hati NGOs"

The CSV file will have a maximum of 1000 records.
